1) Should not allow user to create buttons or sections with same text color as the background color. Should throw an error or warning while creating such an item

2) Should not allow user to create a blank button i.e button without any text in it. Should throw an error or warning while creating such an item

3) There is no validation on the type of file being uploaded to images. I was able to upload PDFs, XLS, JS, DOC files to images. Should throw an erro while uploading invalid file formats
